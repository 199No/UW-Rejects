MAP GUIDE:

Each chunk is encapsulated within curly brackets. A chunk's location in the file is representative of its location on the map.
Chunks are arranged like so:
{data for chunk (0,0) goes in here}{data for chunk (1,0) goes in here}
{data for chunk (0,1) goes in here}{data for chunk (1,1) goes in here}

Each row of tiles within a chunk is seperated by a semicolon, like so:
{data for row 1;data for row 2;data for row 3;data for row 4;}
There should be a semicolon after the last row.             â¬†

In each row, tiles are seperated by commas.
For example, a 3x3 chunk would look like this:
{1,2,1;2,2,2;1,2,2;}

TO EDIT THE MAP:
Go to the mapTool Main.java file.
Click the "Run" button above its main method.
This will set VSCode's default "main" to the MapTool main, so you will have to do this again on the game's Main.java file.
Enter your selected chunk x and y seperated by a comma with no spaces.
Pick a tile to "draw" with using the pallet on the right. The red square indicates the selected tile type.
Press E to switch between env mode and map mode.
Click or drag on a tile to draw over it.
Once you are happy click "Save" and close the window.
Your newly edited map will show up in the toolOutput.map file.
Give it a quick glance to make sure the tool didn't corrupt anything.
Copy everything and go to the map1.map file.
Hit Ctrl+A and Ctrl+V to replace all.
Congrats! Your newly edited chunk is saved in the map.
