//// HOW TO MAKE A MAP ////
{} separates individual chunks
; signals the end of a row within a chunk
Chunks HAVE to be 10x10
Chunks are arranged in the file the way that they will appear in the map. Use the squashy brackets.
E.g.
{chunk at 0, 0}{chunk at 1, 0}
{chunk at 0, 1}{chunk at 1, 1}
When making a map, pull up this file so that you can see it.
1 - Grass
2 - Sand
3 - Snow
4 - Stone
5 - Water (wip)
To make a new chunk:
Copy all the text from map_template. Do NOT overwrite the template.
Paste it into the map.
Edit the tiles to your liking.
Delete all the whitespace so that it looks something like this:
{row1;row2;row3;row4;row5;row6;row7;row8;row9;row10}
Move the chunk to where it needs to be.
