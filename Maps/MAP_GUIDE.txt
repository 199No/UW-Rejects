//// HOW TO MAKE A MAP ////
{} separates individual chunks
; signals the end of a row within a chunk
Chunks HAVE to be 10x10
Chunks are arranged in the file the way that they will appear in the map. Use the squashy brackets.
E.g.
{chunk at 0, 0}{chunk at 1, 0}
{chunk at 0, 1}{chunk at 1, 1}
When making a map, pull up this file so that you can see it.
1 - Grass
2 - Sand
3 - Snow
4 - Stone
5 - Dirt
To edit the map:
1. Open the tool.
2. Select a chunk.
3. Edit and save the chunk.
4. The tool will save your chunk to toolOutput.
5. Make sure that the tool didn't mess up the entire file.
6. Paste the contents of it into map1.map.
